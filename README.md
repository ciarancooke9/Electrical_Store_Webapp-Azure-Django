This is the git repository of the django app we used to create a store front on Azure.

- Html files can be found in store/templates/store/ 
- The products are rendered automatically from our postgres database meaning more products can be added through the admin page and will automatically show on the website in their selected category.
- Code for the database object can be found in store/models.py where we created the product and category models and store/views.py where we pulled them to be rendered in our html.
- Some of the images for the products fail to load sporadically, still trying to fix this issue.
- Only the homepage, product category pages, signup, login and cart pages are present.
